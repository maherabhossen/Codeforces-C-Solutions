My first Git repository
# Codeforces C Solutions

Welcome to my repository of C solutions for Codeforces problems! I'm currently learning C and using competitive programming to sharpen my skills. This repo helps me track my progress, organize my solutions, and build good coding habits.

---

## Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills in C
- Master pointers, memory management, and string handling
- Build a habit of clean code and version control
- Track progress and reflect on learning

---

## Tools & Setup

- Language: C (compiled with GCC)
- Editor: Visual Studio Code
- Debugging: GDB + VS Code integration
- Version Control: Git + GitHub

---

## Future Plans

- Add solutions from other platforms (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank)
- Explore advanced topics like dynamic memory, structs, and file I/O
- Automate testing for common edge cases
